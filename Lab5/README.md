## Lab 5

### Grades 

The only observation I had from the stub was that you can't get a coherent results between all functions since each time a new number (which the calculations are based on) is generated randomly and since they don't share that number we end up with each category displaying a result depending on a random number and all of them differing.
The problem gets fixed once we implement the code the right way.


### Twitter 

Here is a screenshot of all the tests passing :

PS : the function actual_call() gives a different results each time since there isn't always a "me" in the tweets so it's dependent on the result that we don't control unlike the other tests.
